# Anime Search App (In Progress) 💻

This is an **Anime Search App** built with **Next.js (App Router), TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS**. The app allows users to **search for anime**, view details, and explore trending titles. It fetches real-time anime data using the **Jikan API / Anilist API** and stores user-related data in a **database**. The project follows **modern development best practices**, using **import aliases (`@/`)** for better structure and maintainability.

## 📌 Technologies Used
- **Next.js (App Router)** – Framework for optimized, server-side rendered React apps.
- **TypeScript** – Ensures type safety and improves maintainability.
- **Tailwind CSS** – Utility-first CSS framework for fast styling.
- **Jikan API / Anilist API** – Fetches anime data dynamically.
- **Database** – Will be used to store user data.
- **Import Aliases (`@/`)** – Simplifies imports and keeps the project organized.

## 🚀 Project Status
🔨 **Work in Progress** – Currently developing the **search functionality** and **anime details page**. A **database** will be integrated to store user favorites and search history. More features like a **favorites list** and **filtering by genre** will be added soon.
